> *śāstra* — `shashtra` — (disciplined collection of mantras)

## 1. Nāma (Identity)

| Bhāṣā (भाषा) | Diacritic | ASCII | Bolī |
|---------------|------------|--------|------|
| शास्त्र | *śāstra* | `shashtra` | structured collection of mantras |

---

## 2. Uddeshya (Purpose)

A **śāstra** is a **mantra about many mantras** —  
a disciplined body of knowledge that groups related mantras under a coherent intent (*dharma*).  

Within *Gananīti*, every repository of mantras (such as this GitHub repo) **is itself a śāstra**.  
It defines the scope, purpose, authorship, and canonical arrangement of the mantras it holds.

In Bhūmi’s future substrate, each śāstra will live not as a folder but as a record in the **śāstra-table**, written and evolved through *mat-dāna*, *mat-gaḍana*, and *śuddhikāraṇa* processes.

---

## 3. Siddhānta (Principle)

A *śāstra* is both **a mantra** and **a repository** of other mantras.

It represents:
1. **Saṅgraha (collection):** a bounded set of mantras sharing lineage or purpose.  
2. **Niyama (discipline):** the guiding method or rule that binds its mantras.  
3. **Gaṇa-saṃbandha (collective relation):** association with one or more *gaṇas* who author, curate, or maintain it.  
4. **Jīvatva (living nature):** a śāstra evolves through mat processes; its past versions remain part of its lineage.

## 4. Rūpa (Canonical Folder Structure)

```
<repository-root>/
│
├── shashtra/                     ← canonical directory containing mantra folders
│   ├── mantra-a/
│   ├── mantra-b/
│   └── ...
└── shashtra/README.md            ← this file (the śāstra’s own mantra)
```

Each śāstra follows the same structure as any mantra:
```
shashtra/
├── README.md          ← Bhāṣā definition
├── README.en.md       ← Bolī translation
├── yantra.svg         ← symbolic emblem of the śāstra
├── chitra.json        ← conceptual map linking contained mantras
└── anurag.ogg         ← its tonal or musical essence
```

## 5. Vyākhyā (Explanation)

### 5.1. Essence
A śāstra provides **context and coherence** — it tells *why these mantras belong together*.  
It is comparable to a **Git repository**:  
- each *commit* = *mat-dāna*,  
- each *merge* = *mat-gaḍana*,  
- each *cleanup or archival* = *śuddhikāraṇa*.

### 5.2. Relation to Gaṇa
A śāstra always belongs to at least one *gaṇa* (collective mind).  
That gaṇa may be a person, organization, or lineage that sustains its evolution.

### 5.3. Manifestation
In Bhūmi, the śāstra’s metadata (name, gaṇa, purpose, version) will be recorded in the **śāstra-table**, and every included mantra will be linked through the **mantra-table**.

---

## 6. Dharma (Invariants)

1. **Containment:** a śāstra lists canonical paths of its contained mantras.  
2. **Discipline:** each śāstra declares its guiding principle or method (e.g., programming, law, ontology).  
3. **Authorship:** one or more *gaṇas* must be recorded as custodians.  
4. **Continuity:** older versions are never destroyed — only superseded through *śuddhikāraṇa*.  
5. **Uniform Structure:** every contained mantra follows the `README + yantra + chitra + anurāga` schema.

---

## 7. Saṃvāda (Relations)

| Related Mantra | Role |
|-----------------|------|
| [`mantra`](../mantra/README.md) | atomic unit contained in the śāstra |
| `gananiti/shashtra/gan` *(future)* | identifies the collective or individual custodian(s) |
| `gananiti/shashtra/mat` *(future)* | records opinions or stances about mantras or śāstras |
| `gananiti/shashtra/nama-chatushtaya` | provides canonical naming across languages |
| `gananiti/shashtra/lingua` *(future)* | defines translation and cross-Bhasha validation rules |

---

## 8. Dṛṣṭi (Example)

Example: the `gananiti/shashtra` repository is itself a śāstra.  
It contains mantras such as:

- `mantra/` → defines what a mantra is  
- `shashtra/` → defines what a śāstra is  
- `nama-chatushtaya/` → naming discipline  
- `mat/` → opinions about mantras  
- `gan/` → collectives or beings  

Each subfolder is a mantra; the root folder `shashtra/` is their organizing śāstra.

---

## 9. Antarmukhya (Inner Commentary)

A *śāstra* is the **organism of thought**.  
Mantras are its **cells**; *gaṇa* is its **nervous system**; *mats* are its **metabolism**.  
Together they make knowledge **living, versioned, and self-aware**.

Just as a Git repository preserves every change, a śāstra records every mental act — creation, revision, purification — in perpetuity.

## 10. Closing Śloka

> **शास्त्रं तु मन्त्रसमूहम्।**  
> *śāstraṃ tu mantra-samūham* —  
> “A śāstra is a congregation of mantras.”
