# 📜 नामचतुष्टय

> *nāma-catuṣṭaya* — `nama_chatushtaya` — (fourfold name)

---

## 1. Nāma (Identity)

| Form                | Script                | Example            | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bhāṣā (भाषा)**    | Sanskrit (Devanāgarī) | नामचतुष्टय         | The formal, canonical name — expressed in Sanskrit.   |
| **Transliteration** | Latin with diacritics | *nāma-catuṣṭaya*   | Phonetic rendering preserving Sanskrit pronunciation. |
| **ASCII Form**      | Code-safe             | `nama_chatushtaya` | For filenames, URLs, APIs, and programming contexts.  |
| **Bolī (बोली)**     | English               | fourfold name      | Common explanatory name for general comprehension.    |

---

## 2. Uddeshya (Purpose)

The **nāma-catuṣṭaya** mantra defines the **discipline of naming** used throughout *Gananīti-śāstra*.
It ensures that every canonical concept (*mantra*, *śāstra*, *gaṇa*, etc.) is identified **consistently and precisely across languages and contexts**, binding together the philosophical, phonetic, computational, and colloquial worlds.

This mantra formalizes how *Bhāṣā* (formal language) and *Bolī* (common explanation) coexist in Gananīti.

---

## 3. Siddhānta (Principle)

> **Gananīti-śāstra** uses **Sanskrit** as its **Bhāṣā** — the language of definition, grammar, and precision —
> and **English** as its **Bolī** — the language of explanation, translation, and dissemination.

Every canonical entity (mantra, śāstra, yantra, etc.) must present itself through the *fourfold naming* of *nāma-catuṣṭaya*.

Each folder (mantra) may contain multiple README files, one per Bolī:

```
README.md        → Primary (Bhasha)
README.en.md     → English (Bolī)
README.hi.md     → Hindi (Bolī)
README.xx.md     → Other translations
```

All names across languages must refer to the same conceptual *mantra* and differ only in linguistic representation.

---

## 4. Rūpa (Canonical Form)

```yaml
nama_chatushtaya:
  bhasha: "नामचतुष्टय"
  diacritic: "nāma-catuṣṭaya"
  ascii: "nama_chatushtaya"
  boli: "fourfold name"
```

---

## 5. Vyākhyā (Explanation)

The **nāma-catuṣṭaya** declares that every concept has four proper linguistic bodies:

| Plane              | Nature         | Function                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bhāṣā (भाषा)**   | Formal         | Exact representation of essence; the “truth name”.        |
| **Diacritic form** | Phonetic       | Guarantees sound-fidelity independent of script.          |
| **ASCII form**     | Operational    | Enables integration into code, URLs, and data structures. |
| **Bolī (बोली)**    | Conversational | Makes the concept intelligible in everyday discourse.     |

The four together act as a *semantic checksum* — a self-consistent identity system for ideas, ensuring no translation can drift from meaning.

---

## 6. Dharma (Invariants)

1. Every canonical file (mantra or śāstra) must include the fourfold name metadata.
2. The **Bhāṣā name** (Sanskrit) is authoritative — all others derive from it.
3. The **ASCII name** must be unique and filesystem-safe.
4. The **Bolī name** is free for human readability but cannot redefine meaning.
5. All references within the Gananīti corpus must use **one of the four forms** precisely — never mixed.

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gananiti/shashtra/mantra`            | Defines the notion of a canonical idea.                          |
| `gananiti/shashtra/lingua` *(future)* | Will define grammar, syntax, and cross-Bhasha translation rules. |
| `amitu/programming/identifier`        | Describes mapping from names to computational symbols.           |

## 8. Dṛṣṭi (Example in Practice)

Suppose we define a mantra for *table*:

```yaml
nama_chatushtaya:
  bhasha: "तालिका"
  diacritic: "tālikā"
  ascii: "talika"
  boli: "table"
```

When referring to it:

* In **Bhasha** context → use `तालिका`
* In **philosophical / phonetic** writing → use *tālikā*
* In **code or file paths** → use `talika`
* In **expository English text** → say “table”

All four refer unambiguously to the same conceptual entity.

---

## 9. Antarmukhya (Inner Commentary)

In *Gananīti*, **name is ontology**.
A mantra without its *nāma-catuṣṭaya* is like a sound without echo —
it cannot fully travel between realms of thought, speech, and implementation.

The four forms ensure:

* *Bhāṣā* protects metaphysical integrity,
* *Diacritic* protects phonetic precision,
* *ASCII* protects computational fidelity, and
* *Bolī* protects human understanding.

Together they make Gananīti a **multi-lingual yet ontologically unified system**.

## 11. Closing Śloka

> **नामचतुष्टयं पश्येत् यः, स सर्वभाषासु स्थितः।**
> *nāma-catuṣṭayaṃ paśyet yaḥ, sa sarva-bhāṣāsu sthitaḥ.*
> “He who beholds the fourfold name abides in all languages at once.”

### 🔖 Summary

* **Mantra ID:** `gananiti/shashtra/nama-chatushtaya`
* **Meaning:** the fourfold naming system that unites Bhāṣā (formal Sanskrit) and Bolī (English or other explanatory languages).
* **Core Idea:** every concept in Gananīti is named in four precise forms, so that it may live simultaneously in philosophy, sound, code, and conversation.

Would you like me next to create the complementary **`gananiti/shashtra/lingua`** (Language Discipline) śāstra, which will formally define what constitutes a *Bhasha*, *Boli*, *Lipī*, and how mantra translations are versioned and validated across them?
