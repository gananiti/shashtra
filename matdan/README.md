| मतदान | *matdāna* | `matdan` | the act (or request) of communicating a mat |

## 2. Uddeshya (Purpose)

A **matdāna** is simply **the act of communicating** a *mat* —  
to say it aloud, send it across, or otherwise make it reachable to another *gaṇa*.

It may be:
- an *utterance* in speech,  
- a *message* sent across a network,  
- a *publication* shared to a community, or  
- even a *prompt* asking another to respond with a *mat*.

In short:  
> **Mat is the content. Matdāna is the act of saying it.**

---

## 3. Siddhānta (Principle)

A *matdāna* is a **communication event** connecting *gaṇas* through a *mat*.

> **दातृ → मत → आदातृ**  
> *dātṛ → mat → ādātṛ*  
> *(giver → message → receiver)*

Everything else — why it happened, how it travels, what medium it uses — is secondary.  
What matters is that **something is said**, or **someone is invited to say**.

A *matdāna* can thus be of two kinds (conceptually, not categorically):
1. **Offering:** “Here is my mat about *X*.”  
2. **Request:** “Give me your mat about *X*.”  

Both are *matdānas* because both **move meaning** between beings.

## 5. Vyākhyā (Explanation)

### 5.1. Simplicity of the Act

*Matdāna* is **talking** — in the most general, universal sense.  
It’s when something leaves one consciousness and reaches another.

Whether through voice, code, letter, or light pulse — all are *matdānas*.

A *mat* holds the data:  
```yaml
mat:
  datr: gan:amitu
  aadatr: gan:developers
  mantra: wake_up_early
  mantra_sequence: ["recommend", "strongly"]
```

A *matdāna* is the **sending** of that mat, not its content itself.

```yaml
matdan:
  datr: gan:amitu
  aadatr: gan:developers
  mat: mat:wake_up_early_2025
  channel: "speech"     # or "email", "p2p", "bhumi-link"
  status: "sent"
```

---

### 5.2. Requests as Matdāna

When someone says,  
> “Tell me what you think about waking up early,”  
that too is a *matdāna* — a mat of type *request* for another *mat*.

It’s a message carrying **expectation of response**,  
not the response itself.

Thus:
- *Offering* = “Here’s what I think.”  
- *Request* = “What do you think?”  

Both create a bridge — both are *matdānas*.

---

### 5.3. No Necessary Relation to Śāstra

While every *mat* ultimately relates (via its *mantra*) to a *śāstra*,  
*matdāna* is not **about** the śāstra.  
It’s simply how the *mat* travels between *gaṇas* —  
the communication layer of consciousness.  

You could perform a *matdāna* across *śāstras*, across *worlds*, even between *machines*.

---

## 6. Dharma (Invariants)

1. **Direction:** all *matdānas* flow from a *dātṛ* to an *ādātṛ*.  
2. **Medium-agnostic:** how the mat travels (speech, data packet, beam of light) is irrelevant.  
3. **Minimality:** a *matdāna* carries only the *mat-id* and transmission context.  
4. **Volition:** only the *dātṛ* can initiate a *matdāna*; only the *ādātṛ* can interpret it.  
5. **Reciprocity:** a received *matdāna* may trigger a return *matdāna* (a reply).  
6. **Universality:** *matdāna* applies equally to human, digital, or hybrid *gaṇas*.

| [`mantra`](../mantra/README.md) | the subject concept embedded in the mat |
| `gananiti/shashtra/matgadana` *(future)* | dialogue that emerges when multiple matdānas connect |
| `amitu/net/p2p` *(bhūmi)* | possible substrate for actual message passing |

## 9. Antarmukhya (Inner Commentary)

*Matdāna* is **communication stripped of baggage**.  
No systems, protocols, or states are required.  
When one being expresses a *mat*, or invites another to do so, *matdāna* has occurred.

Every conversation, email, law, tweet, broadcast, or shared thought  
is an instance of *matdāna* —  
the raw flow of consciousness through meaning.

It is the **breath of Gananīti**:  
without *matdāna*, all *mats* remain sealed in solitude.

## 10. Closing Śloka

> **यदा मतः श्राव्यः स्यात् तदा मतदानं सम्पन्नम्।**  
> *yadā mataḥ śrāvyaḥ syāt tadā matdānaṃ sampannam.*  
> “When a mat becomes hearable, matdāna has happened.”
