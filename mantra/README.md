# 📜 मन्त्र  
> *mantra* — `mantra` — (conceptual unit of meaning)

---

## 1. Nāma (Identity)

| Bhāṣā (भाषा) | Diacritic | ASCII | Bolī |
|---------------|------------|--------|------|
| मन्त्र | *mantra* | `mantra` | conceptual unit |

---

## 2. Uddeshya (Purpose)

A **mantra** is the **atomic unit of concept and meaning** in *Gananīti*.  
Each mantra represents a single, self-contained **idea** — a definition, a rule, a form, or an essence.  
It is the smallest stable unit of *understanding* and *expression*.

Every other structure in *Gananīti* — *mat*, *gaṇa*, *śāstra*, *yantra*, *chitra* — ultimately refers to, or is built around, *mantras*.

This particular mantra defines **what a mantra is**.

---

## 3. Siddhānta (Principle)

A mantra is both **concept** and **container** of concept.  
It is the point where *thought crystallizes into name*.  
Each mantra is:

1. **Linguistically grounded** — defined using the discipline of [`nāma-catuṣṭaya`](../nama-chatushtaya/README.md).  
2. **Ontologically distinct** — no two mantras carry identical essence.  
3. **Context-independent** — a mantra remains valid even when invoked in new contexts.  
4. **Representationally complete** — can appear as word, sound, form, and relation.

## 4. Rūpa (Canonical Folder Structure)

```
<shashtra>/<mantra>/
│
├── README.md          ← canonical Bhāṣā definition (Sanskrit-centric)
├── README.en.md       ← Bolī (English) explanation
├── yantra.svg         ← pictogram (symbolic face of the mantra)
├── chitra.json        ← conceptual relation map
└── anurag.ogg         ← audio resonance (rāga / sound embodiment)
```

Each mantra folder lives inside its *śāstra* (thematic collection of related mantras).

---

## 5. Vyākhyā (Explanation)

### 5.1. Essence
A *mantra* is the **seed of cognition** —  
it contains meaning, not merely description.  
To define a mantra is to *bring an idea into existence* within Gananīti.

### 5.2. Representation
Every mantra expresses itself through multiple sensory and operational forms:

| Plane | File | Function |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Vāk (वाक्)** — Word | `README.md`, `README.<lang>.md` | Linguistic definition |
| **Chitra (चित्र)** — Form | `chitra.json` | Conceptual and relational visualization |
| **Yantra (यन्त्र)** — Image | `yantra.svg` | Symbolic pictogram |
| **Anurāga (अनुराग)** — Sound | `anurag.ogg` | Aural essence or mood |

These are not decorative — they are *the bodies of the mantra*.

## 6. Dharma (Invariants)

1. **Atomicity:** A mantra defines one conceptual unit.  
2. **Immutability:** Its essence does not change; later clarifications are new mantras.  
3. **Multiplicity of Form:** Each mantra strives for full manifestation (word, sound, image, relation).  
4. **Singular Identity:** Every mantra must have a unique `nāma-catuṣṭaya`.  
5. **Purity of Translation:** README translations explain, not reinterpret.

## 7. Saṃvāda (Relations)

| Related Mantra | Role |
|-----------------|------|
| [`nāma-catuṣṭaya`](../nama-chatushtaya/README.md) | naming discipline for all mantras |
| `gananiti/shashtra/shashtra` *(to be defined)* | container of mantras |
| `gananiti/shashtra/mat` *(later)* | opinions or stances about mantras |
| `gananiti/shashtra/gan` *(later)* | identity or collective associated with a mantra |
| `gananiti/shashtra/yantra` *(future)* | defines pictogram semantics |
| `gananiti/shashtra/chitra` *(future)* | defines relational schema |
| `gananiti/shashtra/anurag` *(future)* | defines auditory encoding |

## 8. Dṛṣṭi (Example)

Example: defining a mantra for *rule*

```
gananiti/shashtra/rule/
├── README.md
├── README.en.md
├── yantra.svg
├── chitra.json
└── anurag.ogg
```

- `README.md` — defines the philosophical essence of “rule”  
- `yantra.svg` — may show a balanced square or boundary  
- `anurag.ogg` — steady rhythmic tone reflecting order  
- `chitra.json` — connects “rule” to “law”, “action”, “limit”

---

## 9. Antarmukhya (Inner Commentary)

In *Gananīti*, **knowledge is alive** only when named.  
The act of naming (*nāma-karaṇa*) is an act of creation.  
A *mantra* thus sits between *thought* and *form* —  
it is the *point of condensation* where the abstract becomes shareable.

To define a mantra is to **utter being**.

## 10. Closing Śloka

> **मन्त्रः शब्दब्रह्मस्वरूपः।**  
> *mantraḥ śabda-brahma-svarūpaḥ* —  
> “A mantra is the form of creative sound itself.”
